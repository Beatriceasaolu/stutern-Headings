          Sci-fictions which is my favorite movie genre. How those hackers

        In CSS, I've learnt about
        <b>padding, borders, margin, specificity, the concept of CSS.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is very important to structure web pages because it act as a basic
        block for styling web pages. Basically, a house without paintings,
        flowers and other things that beautifies a house is not appealing. so
        CSS does the work of the beautification.

        Padding, Margin and Border emerge from the concept of the
        <b>Box Model Layout.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The following is the difference between them.</p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Padding: This is the space between the content and the border.
            Giving a padding to a semantics creates a space between the border
            and the content of that semantics
          </li>
          <li>
            Border: This is the space between the inner content and the outer
            content. Basically, Border lies between margin and padding or the
            actual content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin: This is the outer space of the html semantics. Giving a
            margin to a html semantics creates a space between the border or the
            actual content and the rest of the element in the body of the html
            page.
          </li>
        </ul>
